# Super Geo Agent Readiness

A Claude Skill that covers Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) and agent readiness in one place. SEO targeted blue links. This skill targets the answers AI engines produce, and the agents that fetch and act on your content.

## What it covers

Four optimization surfaces, one routing layer:

- **Content.** Authority, quotability, comprehensiveness, structure. The patterns that get a page cited by ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Google AI Overviews.
- **Technical site.** FAST framework, Schema.org JSON-LD, robots.txt for AI crawlers, `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` at small-site, large-site, and per-directory scales.
- **Platform tactics.** Per-engine optimization for ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, AI Mode, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, and Grok, with current traffic-share numbers so you know where to spend effort.
- **Agent readiness.** MCP Server Cards, A2A Agent Cards, OpenAPI, API Catalog (RFC 9727), OAuth metadata (RFC 8414/9728), Web Bot Auth, x402, ACP, UCP, Markdown content negotiation. Compiled from Cloudflare's agent-readiness work and the agentready.org open specification.

## When Claude triggers it
